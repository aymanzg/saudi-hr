# Changelog

All notable changes to `saudi_hr` are documented in this file.

## v1.19.2 - 2026-08-24

- Fixed the classic Saudi Monthly Payroll workflow so an attached Excel workbook is imported instead of being silently replaced by contract-based employee fetching or recalculation.
- Promoted workbook import to a clear primary action and added Arabic/English guidance that attachment alone does not load payroll values.
- Added an overtime integrity gate and import-result totals so legacy `كشف الرواتب طباعة` files cannot complete silently if overtime is lost.
- Added regression coverage for blocking destructive contract refresh when a source workbook is attached, with matching ERPNext v15 and v16 behavior.

## v1.16.5 - 2026-05-25

- Added the Saudi labor regulations compliance layer for ERPNext v15, including statutory records, ministry filings, document custody, work arrangements, working-time checks, inspection fine SLAs, and final settlement tracking.
- Added Annex 1 disciplinary violation catalog defaults and Annex 2 disability accommodation catalog defaults with legal references and workspace shortcuts.
- Added official Saudi contract print formats for standard, part-time, temporary/casual, and seasonal contracts.
- Added Saudi Labor Coverage Matrix, Saudi Compliance Obligation Backlog, and Saudi Legal Review Queue reports for operational compliance follow-up.
- Added scheduler alerts and validation hooks for ministry filings, document custody, final settlements, inspection fines, WPS corrections, work regulations, expat authorizations, and training disclosures.
- Tightened compliance DocType permissions so HR users can operate records without delete/share privileges while HR managers and system managers retain administrative control.

## v1.16.0 - 2026-04-28

- Added a documented token-based mobile attendance API contract for external apps, including credential issuance, status, location, check-in, and leave request endpoints that preserve the calling user's permissions.
- Added the Employee Org Tree desk page with scoped hierarchy APIs and wired it into the Saudi HR workspace for direct operational access.
- Extended the annual leave workflow with a finance approval stage, Accounts Manager visibility rules, and a reload patch so existing sites receive the updated workflow definition.
- Hardened the mobile attendance web UI by using GET for read-only calls and `Promise.allSettled` so location loading failures no longer collapse the full dashboard.
- Fixed voice verification runtime compatibility with current Torch builds by shimming missing `torch.amp.custom_fwd` and `custom_bwd` hooks before loading SpeechBrain.

## v1.15.0 - 2026-04-27

- Reorganized the Saudi HR workspace into a clearer Arabic-first operational flow covering daily follow-up, employee actions, policies, WPS, governance, and insights.
- Normalized Saudi HR app titles and workspace shortcut labels to canonical English source keys so Arabic rendering is owned consistently by the translation layer.
- Refined the mobile attendance experience with Arabic-only leave types, stronger functional phrasing, dynamic value localization, updated GPS wording, and a refreshed service-worker cache version.
- Converted Attendance Action Hub UI strings from mixed bilingual literals to translatable source keys for proper Arabic publication in the live app.
- Republished workspace and frontend assets so the updated Arabic UX is delivered reliably in production after cache clear.

## v1.12.0 - 2026-04-11

- Hardened Saudi Monthly Payroll workbook imports with blocking validation for missing required columns and critical duplicate-name warnings when rows omit an explicit cost center.
- Added persistent upload guidance on the payroll form, plus a pre-import review gate so risky workbooks are stopped before import.
- Expanded workbook analysis and validation dialogs to surface critical review items directly in the UI.
- Strengthened the detailed payroll import template with highlighted required fields, dropdown-based cost center and payout mode inputs, and numeric validation rules.
- Added a simplified Arabic payroll upload template for end users alongside the detailed administrative template.
- Extended payroll regression coverage for required workbook headers, critical warning detection, zero-salary leave skipping, stricter employee matching, and generated template validations.

## v1.11.0 - 2026-04-07

- Added employee paid payroll history directly on the Employee salary tab, sourced from completed Saudi Monthly Payroll runs with linked journal entries.
- Introduced Salary Adjustment, Promotion Transfer, and Exit Interview DocTypes and linked them into performance review and exit clearance workflows.
- Expanded Saudi Monthly Payroll with workbook validation, import templates, automatic employee creation defaults, cost-center-aware payroll distribution, and grouped journal entry generation.
- Refreshed the Saudi HR workspace structure and shortcuts to surface daily operations, payroll, and lifecycle navigation more clearly.

## v1.8.1 - 2026-04-02

- Extended `Saudi Monthly Payroll Employee` rows to persist workbook-only payroll context fields: work location, designation, salary mode, GOSI registration, working days, absence days, and late hours.
- Updated payroll workbook import mapping so those fields survive the actual import flow and remain visible in imported payroll rows.
- Normalized workbook gross salary when `إجمالي البدلات` already includes `الإضافي`, eliminating false `net salary mismatch` warnings during live payroll imports.
- Allowed placeholder employee creation from imported payroll rows to reuse a valid `Designation` where available.
- Expanded payroll regression coverage and reverified the full `saudi_hr` suite with 78 passing tests.

## v1.8.0 - 2026-04-02

- Removed remaining runtime `ignore_permissions` bypasses from mobile attendance/leave APIs and key compliance, policy, legal, and settings flows.
- Added explicit doctype permission checks for journal entries, compliance actions, regulatory tasks, policy acknowledgements, employee warnings, and disciplinary decision logs.
- Hardened payroll calculations with prorated sick-leave deduction across month boundaries, zero-basic-salary protection, and import audit comments.
- Added concurrency protection for payroll loan deductions so the same installment cannot be deducted by conflicting payroll runs.
- Unified EOSB calculation logic between document validation, helper functions, and preview API, with stricter validation for invalid/over-deducted cases.
- Tightened annual leave validation so requests cannot cross calendar years or start before employee joining date.
- Verified packaging dependencies remain aligned across `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, and `requirements.txt` with only `openpyxl` and `openlocationcode` as runtime package dependencies.
- Expanded regression coverage to 77 tests and verified the full `saudi_hr` suite passes.

## v1.7.0 - 2026-04-01

- Added the comprehensive employee print format and related workspace shortcut.

## v1.6.0 - 2026-03-31

- Expanded automated unit coverage for payroll and account lookup behavior.

## v1.5.0 - 2026-03-27

- Delivered the standalone release above `frappe` and `erpnext` only, with payroll loans and governance doctypes.
